## Features and Methods

- **Google Forms:** We utilized Google Forms to collect survey information and data, which informed our decision-making process.

- **Prototyping with Uizard / Figma:** We used tools like Uizard and Figma during the prototype phase to visualize and refine our ideas, ensuring a clear vision of the final product.

- **Matching Algorithm:** Our matching algorithm draws inspiration from popular dating apps like Tinder. It calculates a compatibility score between two users, enhancing the personalization of the user experience.

- **Flask:** We employed Flask to create endpoints and establish connections between the frontend and the server.

- **Snowflake:** Our database, hosted on Snowflake, enables us to collect user information and facilitate data communication between the backend and frontend as needed.

- **Postman:** Postman was instrumental in testing the APIs we built with Flask, ensuring their functionality and reliability.

- **React Native:** We leveraged the open-source React Native framework to develop our application.

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript was used extensively in the frontend development.
