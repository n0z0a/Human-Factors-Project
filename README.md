# Human-Factors-Project

Project Description: We are helping to solve the issue of negative experiences in online team-based gaming caused by bad teammates, specifically within the online team-based FPS Valorant. We are hoping to reduce the level of harassment that occurs in online interactions and create connections that otherwise would not have existed between Valorant players.

Methods:

Google Forms: was crucial in collecting survey information and data to determine some of our decisions for the app.
Uizard / Figma: helped our prototype phase to fully flesh-out our ideas and visualize the desired final result.
Our Matching Algorithm, which took inspiration from the popular dating app Tinder’s matching algorithm to determine a compatibility score between two users. This algorithm facilitated the personalization of the user experience.
Flask: was used to create endpoints and connect to the frontend and the server.
Snowflake: was used to host our database so that we could collect the user information and send it to the backend / frontend when needed. 
Postman: used to help test our API’s made in Flask.
React Native: open-source framework to create the application.
TypeScript: also used in the front end.
